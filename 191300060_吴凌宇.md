#### 问答题

#### Q1

+ An operating system provides programmers an abstract set of resources instead of the messy hardware ones as an extended machine.
+ An operating system manages hardware resources as a manager.

#### Q2

+ Because the case that when one process does I/O the CPU is not completely free to work on the other process, the multiprogramming is less advantageous. 

#### Q3

+ In the user mode, only some of the instructions can be executed and only some of the features can be used. The executing code has no ability to directly access hardware or reference memory.
+ In the kernel mode, all of the instructions can be executed and all of the features can be used when executing. The executing code has complete and unrestricted access to the underlying hardware.

#### Q4

+ A trap is a hardware interrupt and a trap instruction  which makes the context switch from user-mode to kernel-mode when a program needs to execute a system call or an operation. And after that it will return back to user-mode to execute the next instruction. A user thread requests a system service by executing an instruction that causes a trap to kernel mode. When a kernel thread has completed its kernel execution and is ready to switch back to the corresponding user thread, the kernel layer is called to make the switch to the user thread, which continues its execution in user mode. 

#### Q5

+ Time multiplexing: scheduling a serially-reusable resource among several users(CPU, printer)
+ Space multiplexing: dividing a multiple-use resource up among several users(memory, disk space)
+ Display: Multiple processes needs to display at the same time. In fact, only one process can use the display resource at one time, so the related processes use the time-sharing method to access the resource.
+ Printer: It can be used by multiple processes at the same time. Every process has a specific time interval to use the resource.
+ Keyboard: The resource can be used by one process at a time, so it can be shared by using the multiplexing.
